# Congestive heart failure detection
This is the implementation of "Congestive heart failure detection using random forest classifier" paper by `Zerina Masetic` and `Abdulhamit Subasi`.

## Abstract
Background and objectives: Automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) heartbeat classification is sub-
stantial for diagnosing heart failure. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of machine
learning methods in creating the model which classifies normal and congestive heart failure
(CHF) on the long-term ECG time series.
Methods: The study was performed in two phases: feature extraction and classification phase.
In feature extraction phase, autoregressive (AR) Burg method is applied for extracting fea-
tures. In classification phase, five different classifiers are examined namely, C4.5 decision
tree, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, artificial neural networks and random for-
est classifier. The ECG signals were acquired from BIDMC Congestive Heart Failure and PTB
Diagnostic ECG databases and classified by applying various experiments.
Results: The experimental results are evaluated in several statistical measures (sensitivity,
specificity, accuracy, F-measure and ROC curve) and showed that the random forest method
gives 100% classification accuracy.
Conclusions: Impressive performance of random forest method proves that it plays significant
role in detecting congestive heart failure (CHF) and can be valuable in expressing knowledge
useful in medicine.
